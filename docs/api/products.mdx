# Products API

This guide covers all endpoints related to products, including listing, filtering, and retrieving single products. It explains how each endpoint works, why it exists, and how to use it from the frontend with real code examples.

## Endpoints

### List Products

**Endpoint:** `/api/products`
**Method:** GET

- `category`: Filter by category slug
- `brand`: Filter by brand slug
- `minPrice` / `maxPrice`: Filter by price range
- `inStock`: Only show products in stock (`true`)
- `sort`: Field to sort by (e.g., `price`, `createdAt`)
- `order`: `asc` or `desc`
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `limit`: Items per page (default: 12)

#### Example Request

```http
GET /api/products?search=shoes&category=running&sort=price&order=asc&page=1&limit=20
```

#### Example Response

    "totalPages": 5,

  }
}
```

#### Backend Integration

See [`src/app/api/products/route.ts`](../src/app/api/products/route.ts:17) for the real implementation.
The backend uses Payload CMS to query products, apply filters, and transform the data for frontend use.

#### Frontend Usage

Use [`getProducts`](../src/lib/products.ts:108) to fetch products in the frontend:

```typescript
import { getProducts } from '@/lib/products';

const { products, pagination } = await getProducts(
  { search: 'shoes', inStock: true },
  { field: 'price', direction: 'asc' },
  1,
  20
);
```

### Get Single Product

**Endpoint:** `/api/products/[slug]`
**Method:** GET

#### What It Does

Returns a single product by its slug, including all details and related data.

#### Example Request

```http
GET /api/products/running-shoes
```

#### Example Response

_Same as above, but only one product object in `data`._

#### Backend Integration

See [`src/app/api/products/[slug]/route.ts`](../src/app/api/products/[slug]/route.ts:5) for the real implementation.

#### Frontend Usage

Use [`getProductBySlug`](../src/lib/products.ts:243):

```typescript
import { getProductBySlug } from '@/lib/products';

const product = await getProductBySlug('running-shoes');
```

---

## Common Usage Flows

### Filtering and Pagination

1. User selects filters (e.g., category, brand, price) in the UI.
2. Frontend calls `getProducts` with the selected filters.
3. API returns filtered, paginated products.
4. UI updates with new product list and pagination controls.

### Fetching Product Details

1. User navigates to a product page (e.g., `/products/running-shoes`).
2. Frontend calls `getProductBySlug` with the product slug.
3. API returns full product details.
4. UI displays product info, images, and related products.

## Before/After Example: Frontend-Backend Communication

**Before:**
Frontend used mock data or static JSON.

**After:**
Frontend fetches live data from the API:

```typescript
// Before
const products = mockProducts;

// After
const { products } = await getProducts({ search: 'shoes' });
```
