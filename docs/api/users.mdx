# Users API

This API endpoint is listed in the documentation plan but is not implemented in the codebase (`src/app/api/users/route.ts` not found).
No documentation can be generated until the endpoint exists.

---

## Next Steps

- Implement the `/api/users` endpoint in `src/app/api/users/route.ts` to enable documentation.
- Once implemented, document endpoint purpose, request/response, integration, and access control.
