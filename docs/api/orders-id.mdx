## Code Walkthrough

[`src/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`](src/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts:1):

- Extracts the order ID from the URL.
- Fetches the order from the database using `findByID`.
- Returns the order details or an error if not found.

**Key logic:**
```typescript
const { id } = await params;
const order = await payload.findByID({
  collection: 'orders',
  id: parseInt(id),
  depth: 2,
});
return NextResponse.json(order);
```

## Integration with Frontend

- Used by order detail and tracking pages.
- Consumed via `fetch('/api/orders/123')`.
- Order data is displayed in order detail components.
