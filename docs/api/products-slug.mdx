## Code Walkthrough

[`src/app/api/products/[slug]/route.ts`](src/app/api/products/[slug]/route.ts:1):

- Extracts the product slug from the URL.
- Finds the product by slug and status.
- Transforms the product for frontend use, including images, sizes, colors, and category.
- Returns a 404 if not found.

**Key logic:**
```typescript
const { slug } = await params;
const result = await payload.find({
  collection: 'products',
  where: { slug: { equals: slug }, status: { equals: 'active' } },
  limit: 1,
  depth: 3,
});
if (result.docs.length === 0) {
  return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: 'Product not found' }, { status: 404 });
}
const product = result.docs[0];
// Transform and return product
```

## Integration with Frontend
