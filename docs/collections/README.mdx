# Collections Overview

This section introduces the main data collections that power the Ralhum Sports backend. Each collection represents a core business entity, such as products, brands, categories, media, users, and more. Collections are defined using [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/) and are tightly integrated with the API and backend logic.

## What is a Collection?

A collection is a structured set of documents (records) in the database, each following a defined schema. Collections enable robust data validation, access control, and business logic through hooks and relationships.

## Main Collections

- **Products**: The central catalog of items for sale.
- **Brands**: Information about product brands.
- **Categories**: Product categorization for navigation and filtering.
- **Media**: Uploaded images and files.
- **Users**: System users (admins, managers, customers).
- **Orders**: Customer purchase records.
- **Customers**: Customer profiles.

## Database Relationships Diagram

Below is a DBML diagram showing the relationships between the main collections:

```dbml
Table products {
  id integer [primary key]
  name text
  slug text [unique]
  category integer [ref: > categories.id]
  brand integer [ref: > brands.id]
  price number
  sku text [unique]
  stock number
  status text
  images json
  createdBy integer [ref: > users.id]
  lastModifiedBy integer [ref: > users.id]
  // ...other fields
}

Table categories {
  id integer [primary key]
  name text [unique]
  slug text [unique]
  // ...other fields
}

Table brands {
  id integer [primary key]
  name text [unique]
  slug text [unique]
  // ...other fields
}

Table media {
  id integer [primary key]
  filename text
  // ...other fields
}

Table users {
  id integer [primary key]
  email text [unique]
  // ...other fields
}

Ref: products.category > categories.id
Ref: products.brand > brands.id
Ref: products.images.image > media.id
Ref: products.createdBy > users.id
Ref: products.lastModifiedBy > users.id
```

This diagram illustrates:
- Each product belongs to a single category and brand.
- Each product can have multiple images, each referencing a media file.
- Products track which user created or last modified them.

## How Collections Integrate

Collections are referenced throughout the backend and API:
- [API Reference](../api/README.mdx) — See how collections are exposed via REST endpoints.
- [Backend Overview](../backend-overview.mdx) — Learn how collections, hooks, and access control power business logic.

For detailed schema and business rules for each collection, see the individual documentation modules.
