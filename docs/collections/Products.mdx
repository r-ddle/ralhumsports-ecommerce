### Example: Images Field

Each product can have multiple images, each referencing a Media document:

```typescript
{
  name: 'images',
  type: 'array',
  required: true,
  minRows: 1,
  maxRows: 10,
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'image',
      type: 'upload',
      relationTo: 'media',
      required: true,
      filterOptions: { category: { equals: 'products' } },
    },
    {
      name: 'altText',
      type: 'text',
      admin: { description: 'Alternative text for this image' },
    },
  ],
}
```

---

## Relationships

- **Category**: Each product belongs to one category (`categories` collection).
- **Brand**: Each product is linked to one brand (`brands` collection).
- **Media**: Product images reference uploaded media files.
- **Users**: Tracks who created and last modified the product.

See the [Collections Overview](./README.mdx) for a full DBML diagram.

## Access Control

Access is enforced at the collection level:

```typescript
access: {
  create: isAdminOrProductManager,
  read: ({ req }) => Boolean(req.user),
  update: isAdminOrProductManager,
  delete: isAdmin,
}
```

- Only product managers and above can create or update products.
- All authenticated users can read products.
- Only admins can delete products.

---

## Business Logic & Hooks

The Products collection uses hooks to enforce business rules and automate data:

### Slug Generation

Auto-generates a URL slug from the product name:

```typescript
hooks: {
  beforeValidate: [
    ({ data, operation }) => {
      if ((operation === 'create' || operation === 'update') && data?.name) {
        return data.name
          .toLowerCase()
          .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')
          .replace(/(^-|-$)/g, '')
      }
    },
  ],
}
```

### SKU Generation

Auto-generates a unique SKU if not provided:

```typescript
hooks: {
  beforeValidate: [
    ({ data, operation }) => {
      if (operation === 'create' && !data?.sku) {
        const timestamp = Date.now().toString().slice(-6)
        const random = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 5).toUpperCase()
        return `RS-${timestamp}-${random}`
      }
    },
  ],
}
```

### Created/Modified By

Automatically sets `createdBy` and `lastModifiedBy` fields:

```typescript
hooks: {
  beforeChange: [
    async ({ req, operation, data }) => {
      if (operation === 'create') data.createdBy = req.user?.id
      if (operation === 'update') data.lastModifiedBy = req.user?.id
      // ...other logic
      return data
    },
  ],
}
```

### Stock and Pricing Validation

- If stock is 0 and status is `active`, status is set to `out-of-stock`.
- Throws an error if `originalPrice` is less than `price`.

### Logging and Analytics

- Logs product creation, updates, deletions, and stock changes.
- Warns on low stock (when stock falls below threshold).

### Integration with Other Collections

- On product create/update, attempts to update category and brand product counts.
- Product images are filtered to only allow media with category `products`.

## Summary

The Products collection is highly structured, enforces business rules through hooks, and integrates with other collections for a robust e-commerce backend. For more details on API usage and backend logic, see the linked modules above.
