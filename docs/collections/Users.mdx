# Users Collection

This document explains the Users collection schema, hooks, access control, business logic, and integration points.

---

## Overview

- **Collection:** `users`
- **Purpose:** Stores user accounts, roles, and permissions for system access and management.

---

## Schema

**Key fields:**
- `firstName` (text): User's first name.
- `lastName` (text): User's last name.
- `email` (text, required, unique): User's email address (used as login).
- `role` (enum): User role (`super-admin`, `admin`, `product-manager`, `content-editor`).
- `isActive` (checkbox): Whether the user account is active.
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (date): Timestamps for audit.

**Example:**
```typescript
{
  firstName: 'Alice',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  role: 'admin',
  isActive: true
}
```

## Access Control

- **Create:** Admins only.
- **Read:** Super admins can access all users; users can access their own profile.
- **Update:** Super admins and users (for their own profile).
- **Delete:** Super admins only.
- **Public Registration:** Disabled.

---

## Hooks & Business Logic

- **Role-Based Access:** Functions like `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isAdminOrProductManager`, and `isAdminOrContentEditor` enforce permissions.
- **Self-Access:** Users can only access or update their own profile unless they are super admin.
- **Admin UI:** Uses `email` as the title and displays columns for first name, last name, email, role, and active status.

## DBML Diagram Reference

See the main DBML diagram for relationships between users and other collections.

## Integration Points

- **APIs:** Used for authentication, authorization, and user management.
- **Frontend:** Consumed by admin dashboards and profile management.
- **Related Components:** [`src/components/account/`](../../src/components/account/)

---

## Beginner Tips

- Only super admins can delete users.
- Use strong, unique emails for each user.
- Assign roles carefully to enforce least privilege.
