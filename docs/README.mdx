# Backend Documentation Overview

Welcome to the backend documentation for this project. This guide is designed for frontend developers who are new to backend work, focusing on practical understanding and real-world examples from the codebase.

## What You'll Learn

- The structure and purpose of backend components
- How API routes are organized and implemented
- How data models (collections) are defined and used
- How the frontend communicates with the backend
- Step-by-step setup and integration guides
- References to visual diagrams and further modules

## Progressive Learning Path

1. **Backend Architecture Overview**
   Start with [`backend-overview.mdx`](./backend-overview.mdx) to understand the big picture: how API routes, data models, and utilities fit together.

2. **API Route Walkthroughs**
   See real examples of how endpoints are implemented and how requests flow through the backend.

3. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   Learn how the frontend fetches data from the backend, with practical code examples.

4. **Advanced Topics**
   Explore authentication, rate limiting, and security patterns in later modules.

## Visual Diagrams

Refer to the [Backend Architecture Diagram](./diagrams/backend-architecture.png) for a visual overview of component relationships.
